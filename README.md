# Weather App

Do what Aristotle wished he could do and know the weather at any time!

## Where To Find It

Visit the [live project here](https://stuvascript.github.io/weather-app/).

## How To Use It

Upon initial load, it will detect your location and display the weather near you.

### Searching

- To search for a new location, enter the city name in the search field and either press `Enter` or click the magnifying glass icon.

Example: `Paris`

- If there are more than one city that share the same name, a dropdown menu will appear and you can click on the correct location.

- If you don't see the correct city in the dropdown list, try typing in the city and the region.

Example: `Paris Texas`

- If you still don't see the correct city in the dropdown list, try typing in the city and the country.

Example: `Paris France`

- And a final option is to type in the ZIP/postal code.

Example: `75460`

### Switching Between Metric and Imperial

To toggle the displayed data between the metric system and the imperial system, simply click the '°F' or the '°C' buttons located under the search bar.
